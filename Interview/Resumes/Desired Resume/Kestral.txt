Kestral
========

It is a built-in web server 
Developer don't need to configure a web server to run the application 

Request Pipeline
================

Once a request reaches our application through Kestrel, it is processed by a no. of steps that make up the request pipeline. These steps are called middleware.

If we don't configure any middleware in our application our application would simply do nothing when it receives a request.

We have to plugin middleware for routing or to use static files
Same for Authorization

e.g

UseRouting()
UseStaticFiles()
UseAuthorization()

The order in which middleware is plugged in is important.
Request data travels through the middleware in Sequence.
